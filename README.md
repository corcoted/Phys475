Currently this repository is in disarray. A few highlights:

* `WeakZeeman.ipynb` calculates the Zeeman (magnetic field) effect in hydrogen-like atoms using perturbation theory.
* `TDSE/` demonstrates numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation using the half-step method.
* `TISE-Numerov.ipynb` solves 1D potentials numerically using Numerov's method (matrix solution in the position basis).

Most of the other files are just fragments that I used to generate figures for my lecture notes, or other quick calculations.

All code is distributed as-is, with no claim to correctness or usefulness.
