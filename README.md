Currently this repository is in disarray. A few highlights:

* `Lecture14-combined.ipynb` compares several approximation methods applied to 1D harmonic oscillator.
* `hydrogen.ipynb` plotting some hydrogen wavefunctions
* `HydrogenSympy.ipynb` calculating some integrals of the hydrogen wavefunctions.
* `WeakZeeman.ipynb` calculates the Zeeman (magnetic field) effect in hydrogen-like atoms using perturbation theory.
* `TDSE/` demonstrates numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation using the half-step method.

Most of the other files are just fragments that I used to generate figures for my lecture notes, or other quick calculations.

All code is distributed as-is, with no claim to correctness or usefulness.
